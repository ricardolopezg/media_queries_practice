    <h2>Alex Rodriguez's Retirement Announcement Means Bonds Will Keep Home Run Throne</h2><br>
      <p>
      <img src="http://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/585/093/hi-res-119cf90d36e3907262d64357f12eab97_crop_north.jpg?w=630&h=420&q=75"><br>
        Two more seasons. That's how much time remains in the Alex Rodriguez Era. And, yes, it deserves a capital "E."<br><br>

        We learned A-Rod's expiration date on Wednesday, when the polarizing New York Yankees slugger confirmed to ESPN.com's Andrew Marchand that he plans to hang 'em up when his current contract expires after the 2017 campaign.<br><br>

        "I've really enjoyed my time," Rodriguez said, per Marchand. "For me, it is time for me to go home and be dad."<br><br>

        There will be ample opportunities to dissect Rodriguez's legacy. There will be retrospectives, hit pieces and undoubtedly some unapologetic apologists. Whatever your feelings on A-Rod—outrage, adulation, indifference—there's no denying he is one of the most talented, fascinating, enigmatic players of his generation.<br><br>

        Today, though, as we chew on the notion of Major League Baseball minus one of its biggest modern figures, let's narrow our focus to Rodriguez, Barry Bonds and the all-time home run record.<br><br>

        Bonds, of course, reigns alone atop dinger mountain with 762 career bombs. Hank Aaron owns the No. 2 slot—and a place in the hearts of baseball purists—with 755. After that, it's Babe Ruth with 714 and A-Rod with 687 and counting.<br><br>

        Back in February 2015, Rodriguez apparently told Bonds he had visions of taking over the top spot.<br><br> 
      <img src="http://img.bleacherreport.net/img/article/media_slots/photos/002/401/412/hi-res-89602ce618462d9807f619a58c7d07b6_crop_exact.jpg?w=650&h=433&q=85"><br>

        "He was funny," Bonds said at the time, after spending a few days working out with Rodriguez in the Bay Area, per the San Francisco Chronicle's John Shea. "He said, 'I want to take your record.' I said, 'That's OK. If that's what you want to do, we've got a lot of work to do.' I was excited he wanted to do it."<br><br>

        At the time, it seemed far-fetched. Rodriguez was coming off a season-long performance-enhancing drug suspension. He was just shy of his 40th birthday. And he hadn't hit more than 18 home runs in a season since 2010.<br><br>

        But this is A-Rod. Say what you will about the guy, but he has built a legacy on defying expectations.<br><br>

        And so in 2015, he launched 33 long balls, his highest total since 2008. And, suddenly, the record seemed like a faint possibility rather than a fantasy. If A-Rod could find a team after 2017, maybe he could toil into his mid-40s and replace Bonds' tally with another, equally controversial number.

    <h2>Noah Syndergaard Could Become Best of Mets' Pitching Stars in 2016</h2><br>
      <p>
      <img src="http://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/584/755/hi-res-b189ce772df4343cb8db1bd700218ad2_crop_north.jpg?w=630&h=420&q=75"><br>
        Like a poker hustler dealing from the bottom of a loaded deck, the New York Mets are flush with aces. The only question is, who's the ace? The stud among studs. The stopper. The arm you turn to when everything is on the line.<br><br>

        Is it Matt Harvey, the Dark Knight himself, freed from last season's ultimately moot innings-limit controversy?<br><br>

        Is it Jacob deGrom, who followed his 2014 National League Rookie of the Year season with a steady, superlative 2015?<br><br>

        Those are excellent options, and no one would argue too vehemently with either. But there's a third member of New York's vaunted rotation who might be an even better choice.<br><br>

        We're talking, as you've no doubt guessed, about Noah Syndergaard. The kid with the crackling fastball and the flowing golden locks who gets mistaken for a Norse god (or a Marvel superhero, depending on how you parse it).

        ACTIVATE THE HYPE MACHINE!<br><br>

        This is just our biased opinion, but baseball is a fine sport that always offers plenty to get excited about whenever a new season is on deck. Heck, in a league with 30 teams and hundreds of players, there's really no end to the reasons to be excited.
